                                                world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors 
                                                that lead to remarkable results.

                                                If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to 
                                                change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system 
                                                that can take you to new heights.

                                                poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, 
                                                Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes.

                                            <p class="card-text description" style="display: none;">Don Quixote has become so entranced by reading chivalric romances that he determines to become a knight-errant himself. 
                                                In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray—he tilts at windmills, 
                                                imagining them to be giants—Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' 
                                                imaginations for nearly four hundred years.

                                                With its experimental form and literary playfulness, Don Quixote has been generally recognized as the first modern novel. The book has been enormously influential on a host of writers, 
                                                from Fielding and Sterne to Flaubert, Dickens, Melville, and Faulkner, who reread it once a year, "just as some people read the Bible."</p>

                                                tells the poignant and fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic 
                                                family and the impact of Western ideas. In consequence, he feels himself "disqualified from being human" (a literal translation of the Japanese title).

                                                Donald Keene, who translated this and Dazai's first novel, The Setting Sun, has said of the author's work: 
                                                "His world … suggests Chekhov or possibly postwar France, … but there is a Japanese sensibility in the choice and presentation of 
                                                the material. A Dazai novel is at once immediately intelligible in Western terms and quite unlike any Western book." 
                                                His writing is in some ways reminiscent of Rimbaud, while he himself has often been called a forerunner of Yukio Mishima.</p>

                                                “fascinating,” Robert Greene and Joost Elffers have distilled three thousand years of the history of power into 
                                                48 essential laws by drawing from the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and Carl Von Clausewitz and also from 
                                                the lives of figures ranging from Henry Kissinger to P.T. Barnum.

                                                Some laws teach the need for prudence (“Law 1: Never Outshine the Master”), others teach the value of confidence 
                                                (“Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness”), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (“Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally”). 
                                                Every law, though, has one thing in common: an interest in total domination. In a bold and arresting two-color package, 
                                                The 48 Laws of Power is ideal whether your aim is conquest, self-defense, or simply to understand the rules of the game.</p>

                                            <p class="card-text description" style="display: none;">Baek Se-Hee is a successful young social media director at a 
                                                publishing house when she begins seeing a psychiatrist about her--what to call it?--depression? She feels persistently 
                                                low, anxious, endlessly self-doubting, but also highly judgemental of others. She hides her feelings well at work and 
                                                with friends, adept at performing the calmness, even ease, her lifestyle demands. The effort is exhausting and overwhelming 
                                                and keeps her from forming deep relationships. This can't be normal. But if she's so hopeless, why can she always summon 
                                                a yen for her favourite street food, the hot, spicy rice cake, tteokbokki? Is this just what life is like? Recording her 
                                                dialogues with her psychiatrist over a 12-week period, Baek begins to disentangle the feedback loops, knee-jerk reactions, 
                                                and harmful behaviours that keep her locked in a cycle of self-abuse.</p>

                                            <p class="card-text description" style="display: none;">The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. 
                                                It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience 
                                                full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night.
                                                <br><br>
                                                But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, 
                                                who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, 
                                                this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination 
                                                and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker 
                                                and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.
                                                <br><br>
                                                True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus 
                                                performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead.
